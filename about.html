            <h1>About Markdown Checklist</h1>
            <p>The story behind a simple solution to a common problem</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <h1>Why This Tool Exists</h1>
            
            <p>This tool was born from frustration with messy operational reports. You know the type - certificate expiry lists from monitoring bots, Teams alerts about renewals, or any other markdown dump that you need to work through systematically but can't easily track progress on. The problem was simple: you'd get a long list of tasks and then... what? No way to tick things off, no progress tracking, no ability to focus on specific sections.</p>
            
            <p>Most solutions were either too complex for the job or completely missed the point. You don't need project management software when you just want to work through an existing list efficiently.</p>
            
            <h2>What Makes It Different</h2>
            
            <p>Most existing tools fall into two camps:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex project management tools</strong> - Great for creating new projects, but complete overkill when you just want to work through an existing list</li>
                <li><strong>Visual checklist designers</strong> - Perfect for creating printable checklists, but not designed for operational data you already have</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This tool sits in the sweet spot between them. It's specifically designed for taking existing markdown content and making it actionable. Paste, click, get work done.</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy-First Design</h2>
            
            <p>Everything happens in your browser. No accounts, no servers processing your data, no analytics tracking what you paste. This matters when you're working with sensitive operational data like certificate details, server configurations, or internal documentation.</p>
            
            <p>You can literally disconnect from the internet after the page loads and it'll still work perfectly. Your data never leaves your machine.</p>
            
            <h2>Built for Real Work</h2>
            
            <p>The features evolved from actual usage patterns:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collapsible headers</strong> - Because you need to focus on "Critical - Next 7 Days" without being distracted by "Low Priority - Next Quarter"</li>
                <li><strong>Minimisable input panel</strong> - Once you've pasted your content, get it out of the way and focus on the actual work</li>
                <li><strong>Progress tracking</strong> - See exactly how much you've accomplished and what's left to tackle</li>
                <li><strong>Session persistence</strong> - Your progress survives page refreshes until you close the browser</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Technical Philosophy</h2>
            
            <p>This is intentionally a simple, single-purpose tool. No frameworks, no build process, no unnecessary complexity. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that does exactly what it says it will do.</p>
            
            <p>It loads fast, works offline, and you can easily save a copy locally if you want your own version. Sometimes the simplest approach is the best approach.</p>
            
            <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
            
            <p>While it started with certificate renewal lists, people use it for all sorts of operational tasks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Operational runbooks and maintenance checklists</li>
                <li>Project task lists from markdown documentation</li>
                <li>Meeting action items and follow-ups</li>
                <li>System maintenance procedures</li>
                <li>Code review and deployment checklists</li>
                <li>Travel planning and event coordination</li>
            </ul>
